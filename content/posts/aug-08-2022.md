I finished prepping and priming about half the parts on the horizontal stabilizer today. I did find a few small dimpling mistakes, where I accidentally mirrored the dimples. It was easy to correct with the squeezer and a flat set. Tomorrow I will finish priming, and start on assembly of everything.

I also started getting together the parts on my elevators. I found a small bit of damage I missed when unpacking the crate. It appears it might have been from manufacturing. I attempted to correct it, but it required an excessive amount of force on the vice and mallet. I dont see how it could have been from shipping. Will email Vans and see what they say.

I spent 2 hours today deburring the h-stab skins and dimpling. I was able to complete everything except the 4 holes per skin that require the close quarters dimple die. Unfortunately I am out of nails and need to resupply at Home Depot.

I later found I could reach them by removing the table on my DRDT-2, so the skins are ready for priming.
